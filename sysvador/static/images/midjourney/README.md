# Don't use these images before we have decided to switch to midjourney and payed for comersial use

It's OK for me (Daniel Haugstvedt) as a person to use midjourney to learn the limits of these new models.

I can also share the images. However, when working, I can't use the service without viloating the comercial terms. The lisence does allow me to give away images, but I don't think that would be the way to go.

Let's not use the images before . I will keep the image I gave to my boss in this folder so we have a reference for the size and resolution we could expect if we shift. Don't display it in the app.
