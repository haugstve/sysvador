Commercial Terms
Basically you can use unlimited images (of your own creation) for whatever you want, as long as you meet the following conditions:
Your account is essentially only used by you (we don't want large groups sharing single accounts).
If you are using our service for your work as an employee of a corporation with more than $1M/yr in revenue (and you want these terms) you MUST update to the 'corporate' plan via typing /subscribe and clicking "enterprise" (it is $50/mo paid annually).
if your project has anything to do with blockchain, you must pay a 20% royalty on revenue over $20k/mo.
Please keep in mind that these terms are beta and we will continue to iterate on them as the beta progresses. Read the complete terms in the Discord #rules channel.
